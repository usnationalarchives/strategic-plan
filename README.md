### DRAFT FY 2018 - FY 2022 Strategic Plan

Our new draft Plan  reaffirms NARAâ€™s current mission, vision, values, and strategic goals. We have updated our strategic objectives to reflect our ongoing commitment to public access and digitization. Notably, the Plan provides Federal agencies, already implementing electronic records management, with a deadline for the next step in the transition to fully-electronic recordkeeping: "By December 31, 2022, NARA will no longer accept transfers of permanent or temporary records in analog formats and will accept records only in electronic format and with appropriate metadata." You may submit comments directly on GitHub or by emailing strategy@nara.gov. Please submit your comments by September 1, 2017. The draft available today is the next step in meeting the requirement to deliver a final plan in February 2018.
