## NARA Mission, Vision, and Values


### Mission Statement

#### We drive openness, cultivate public participation, and strengthen our nation’s democracy through public access to high-value government records.
Our mission is to provide public access to Federal Government records in our custody and control. Public access to government records strengthens democracy by allowing Americans to claim their rights of citizenship, hold their government accountable, and understand their history so they can participate more effectively in their government.


### Vision
#### We will be known for cutting-edge access to extraordinary volumes of government information and unprecedented engagement to bring greater meaning to the American experience.
We collaborate with other Federal agencies, the private sector, and the public to offer information—including records, data, and context—when, where, and how it is needed and transform the American public’s relationship with their government. We will lead the archival and information professions to ensure archives thrive in a digital world. 


### NARA Values
**Collaborate:**	Create an open, inclusive work environment that is built on respect, communication, integrity, and collaborative team work.

**Innovate:** Encourage creativity and invest in innovation to build our future.

**Learn:** Pursue excellence through continuous learning and become smarter all the time about what we know and what we do in service to others.

Our values reflect our shared aspirations that support and encourage our long-standing commitment to public service, openness and transparency, and the government records that we hold in trust.
