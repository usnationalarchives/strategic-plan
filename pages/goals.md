## NARA Strategic Goals and Objectives

NARA’s strategic goals identify the four key areas in which NARA must excel in order to efficiently and effectively deliver its mission in a modern environment.

### Make Access Happen

*Make Access Happen* affirms that “public access” is NARA’s core mission and is a higher calling that gives purpose and meaning to all our work. We are reaching beyond the traditional role of making records available for others to discover and we are instead *making access happen* by delivering increasing volumes of electronic records to the American public online, using flexible tools and accessible resources that promote public participation. In order to achieve success in this goal, NARA must digitize billions of pages of records we hold in analog formats, keep pace with the continuous stream of new records we receive each year, and develop new ways to help citizens find our records through the online National Archives Catalog.

− *By FY 2020, NARA will digitize 500 million pages of records and make them available online to the public through the National Archives Catalog.*

− *By FY 2021, 82 percent of NARA holdings will be processed to enable discovery and access by the public.*

− *By FY 2025, NARA will provide finding aids to 95 percent of the holdings described in the National Archives Catalog.*

### Connect with Customers

*Connect with Customers* challenges us to continuously improve customer service, cultivate public participation, and generate new understanding of the importance of records in a democracy. We continuously engage with and learn from our customers: individuals, organizations, and other Federal agencies. We build long-term and strategic customer relationships to ensure our services are valued by our customers and we work together to improve overall efficiency and effectiveness.

− *By FY 2020, 93 percent of customer requests will be ready within the promised time.*

− *By FY 2020, NARA will achieve a 90 percent satisfaction rating from participants in public engagement activities.*

− *By FY 2025, NARA will have 1 million records enhanced by citizen contributions to the National Archives Catalog.*

### Maximize NARA’s Value to the Nation

*Maximize NARA’s Value to the Nation* recognizes that public access to government information creates measurable economic value, which adds to the enduring cultural and historical value of our records. We are reforming and modernizing records management policies and practices across the Federal government to support the transition to digital government. NARA will drive public and commercial re-use of historical government data and records to create measurable economic activity.

− *By FY 2019, NARA will conduct inspections of records management practices at 10 percent of Federal agencies, to ensure that Federal email and other permanent electronic records are being managed in an electronic format.*

− *By December 31, 2022, NARA will no longer accept transfers of permanent or temporary records in analog formats and will accept records only in electronic format and with appropriate metadata.*

− *By FY 2025, NARA’s data will be used as a primary data source by at least 15 external sources.*

### Build our Future through Our People

*Build our Future through our People* is our commitment to provide all our employees with learning and leadership opportunities necessary to successfully transition to a digital environment. We are dedicated to empowering our employees to engage in their work, innovating to improve our work processes and products, and becoming the next generation of leaders. We are building an inclusive, empowering workplace culture that connects employees with the agency mission. We are developing a diverse workforce with the skills necessary to fulfill our mission.

− *By FY 2020, 40 percent of NARA staff at all grade levels will have participated in a formal leadership development program activity to support the agency effort to build an agency of leaders.*

− *By FY 2020, 85 percent of NARA positions will be filled within 80 days.*

− *By FY 2020, 95 percent of NARA positions will have clear and achievable career paths for NARA employees.*
