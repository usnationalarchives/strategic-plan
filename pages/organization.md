## NARA Organization
NARA’s organizational structure focuses agency resources and management attention on delivering coordinated and effective services to key stakeholders and customers.  NARA’s customer-focused organizations allow the agency to better engage its stakeholders, encourage their collaboration and participation, and respond to their needs expediently and efficiently.  This structure eliminates duplication of processes and resources, creates a more flexible and agile organization, and promotes shared accountability for the performance of the agency as a whole.
