## Instructions for Feedback

We welcome your comments and questions. You may provide feedback in two ways:

1. Comments are welcome via GitHub "issues." Each issue is a conversation initiated by a member of the public. Select the "<a href="https://github.com/{{ site.org_name }}/{{ site.repo_name }}/issues/">Discuss</a>" link to view and comment on existing discussions or open a new issue. You will need to create a GitHub account to submit.

2. We are also accepting content suggestions or proposed revisions through emails sent to <a href='mailto:strategy@nara.gov'>strategy@nara.gov</a>.
