## Transformational Outcomes

NARA transformational outcomes describe the organizational culture that NARA must build in order to meet the challenges of the future, improve organizational performance, and better serve the American people. 

NARA’s Transformation is guided by six “transformational outcomes” that describe how we will fulfill our mission in a modern environment.

**One NARA** — We will work as one NARA, not just as component parts.

**Out in Front** — We will embrace the primacy of electronic information in all facets of our work and position NARA to lead accordingly.

**An Agency of Leaders** — We will foster a culture of leadership, not just as a position but as the way we all conduct our work.

**A Great Place to Work** — We will transform NARA into a great place to work through trust and empowerment of all of our people, the agency’s most vital resource.

**Customer-Focused Organization** — We will create structures and processes to allow our staff to more effectively meet the needs of our customers.

**An Open NARA** — We will open our organizational boundaries to learn from others.
