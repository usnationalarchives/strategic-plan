## Strategic Goal 4.	Build Our Future Through Our People

*Build our Future through our People* is our commitment to provide all our employees with learning and leadership opportunities necessary to successfully transition to a digital environment. We are dedicated to empowering our employees to engage in their work, innovating to improve our work processes and products, and becoming the next generation of leaders. We are building an inclusive, empowering workplace culture that connects employees with the agency mission. We are developing a diverse workforce with the skills necessary to fulfill our mission.

### 4.1	By FY 2020, 40 percent of NARA staff at all grade levels will have participated in a formal leadership development program activity to support the agency effort to build an agency of leaders. 

NARA must have a cadre of skilled leaders – in supervisory and non-supervisory positions – in order to effectively transition to a fully-electronic environment. NARA invests in leadership development activities to ensure the agency has a diverse pool of competent leaders with appropriate technical skills and experience. Currently, 32 percent of NARA employees have participated in a formal leadership development program activity in the past five years. NARA must expand and enhance its leadership development program to provide more opportunities for staff participation and development. 

Strategies: 
-	Re-design NARA’s Supervisor Development Program and establish regular refresher training for all managers and supervisors. 
-	Enhance NARA’s cross-training program to include more opportunities in leadership roles. 
-	Expand course offerings to provide more opportunities for staff at field locations. 
-	Develop standards and metrics to evaluate program effectiveness. 

Contributing Programs: 	Office of Human Capital.

### 4.2	By FY 2020, 85 percent of NARA positions will be filled within 80 days.

NARA must have an effective hiring process in order to reach the best talent in a competitive market.  NARA measures performance using the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 80-day “time to hire” standard, beginning with the hiring manager’s initial request to fill a vacancy to the employee’s start date. 

NARA must have a highly-qualified, highly-motivated, and diverse workforce in order to achieve the agency’s strategic goals and objectives. Currently, approximately 53 percent of NARA positions are filled within 80 days. NARA must fill more positions within the 80-day standard in order to secure the best candidates and minimize the disruption of extended vacancies. 

Strategies: 
-	Improve human capital business processes and make better use of technology. 
-	Realign how the Office of Human Capital delivers services to internal customers.
-	Ensure managers and supporting Human Capital staff are appropriately trained. 

Contributing Programs: 	Office of Human Capital.

### 4.3	By FY 2020, 95 percent of NARA positions will have clear and achievable career paths for NARA employees.

“Career pathing” at NARA is a structured process of analyzing organizational units to reduce managerial span-of-control, redesign core jobs to improve employee motivation and productivity, and ensure a fairer and more effective performance management system. 

NARA must have a motivated workforce that is organized into effective work units in order to achieve the agency’s mission and goals. NARA must address imbalances in the organizational structure, assignment of work, and performance management standards to better support employee motivation and engagement. NARA staff must see reasonable and achievable paths to rewarding and productive careers in order to engage in their work and build an inclusive workplace. To date, NARA has completed career pathing for approximately 36 percent of agency positions. NARA must establish transparent and meaningful career paths to ensure the agency has a motivated and diverse workforce with the skills necessary to fulfill the agency mission. 

Strategies: 
-	Redesign front-line positions to improve employee empowerment.
-	Assess and correct appropriate supervisor-to-employee ratios.
-	Develop new positions in journey grades to increase analytical work and encourage technical subject matter expertise. 
-	Resolve additional barriers to career progression and build inclusive work units.

Contributing Programs: 	Office of Human Capital; Office of Equal Employment Opportunity.

### 4.4	By FY 2020, NARA will have a career development program in place to support NARA’s transition to electronic records. 

NARA must ensure employees are prepared to transition to a fully electronic environment and are prepared to support other agencies with new tools, guidance, and expertise. NARA must provide a robust career development program consisting of training and experiential learning that allows all employees to identify and plan for career growth opportunities and develop competencies. NARA must develop a diverse workforce that is appropriately trained and empowered to participate in an inclusive workplace, and able to effectively support the migration to a fully electronic environment. 

Strategies: 
-	Identify competencies and requirements to support career development.
-	Transform career development and job-skill training programs to meet the needs of electronic records. 
-	Expand NARA’s cross-training program to offer more opportunities in a broader range of roles. 
-	Develop job-specific development programs to build professional competencies. 

Contributing Programs: 	Office of Human Capital.
