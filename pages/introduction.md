## Agency Overview


The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is an independent agency established in 1934 to identify, protect, preserve, and make publicly available the historically valuable records of all three branches of the Federal government. NARA manages the Federal government’s archives, administers a system of Presidential Libraries, operates museums, conducts education and public programs, provides oversight of government-wide records management activities, and provides temporary storage of other agencies’ records on their behalf. NARA publishes the Federal Register and makes grants through the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. NARA provides for the appropriate declassification of classified national security information, mediating Freedom of Information Act disputes, and overseeing agency actions regarding classified and controlled, unclassified information.

NARA holds over 5 million cubic feet (equivalent to 12.5 billion pages) of permanently valuable archival Federal and Presidential records in traditional (analog) formats, and 712 terabytes of electronic archival records. NARA provides access to archival records at public research rooms located across the country, through the online National Archives Catalog, and in response to written correspondence, email, and telephone requests. NARA engages the public with archival records through our website, archives.gov, educational and public programs, and museum exhibits at the National Archives Museum in Washington, DC and thirteen Presidential Libraries. NARA holds over 660,000 artifacts, primarily Presidential materials, which add context and support understanding of the events documented in NARA’s records. 

NARA provides a variety of services to other Federal agencies. NARA stores and services nearly 28 million cubic feet of other agencies’ records, on a reimbursable basis, through the Federal Records Centers Program (FRCP). NARA helps other agencies meet their Federal records management responsibilities through regulations, policies, training, and oversight. NARA facilitates the regulatory process by providing public notice and soliciting public comments on proposed agency rulemakings through the Federal Register. NARA manages the declassification of historical, classified records and provides agencies with standardized processes to ensure their interests are identified and appropriately considered in the declassification process. NARA supports government-wide information policy by providing Federal agencies and industry with standards for protecting sensitive Government information and by supporting the effective administration of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) across the Executive Branch.
