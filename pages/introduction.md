## Agency Overview


The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is an independent agency created in 1934 to identify, protect, preserve, and make publicly available the historically valuable records of all three branches of the Federal government. NARA manages the Federal government’s archives, administers a system of Presidential Libraries, operates museums, conducts education and public programs, provides oversight of government-wide records management activities, and provides temporary storage of other agencies’ records on their behalf. NARA publishes the Federal Register and makes grants through the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. NARA is charged with additional responsibilities, including appropriate declassification of classified national security information, mediating Freedom of Information Act disputes, and overseeing agency actions regarding classified and controlled, unclassified information.
